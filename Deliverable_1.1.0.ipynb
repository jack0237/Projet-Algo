    "\n",
    "CesiCDP has been tasked with developing an innovative solution in response to ADEME's call for promoting new mobility solutions. The focus of this project is on optimizing delivery routes across a road network, with the goal of minimizing travel times while considering real-world challenges such as varying traffic conditions. This problem is framed within the context of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is a central issue in logistics and transportation optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "VRP can be seen as an extension of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic optimization problem. The purpose of this deliverable is to formally model the VRP, analyze its complexity, and explore its relationship with the TSP, a problem known to be NP-complete. By understanding the underlying theoretical properties of the VRP, we can lay the groundwork for developing effective algorithmic solutions."

    "The goal of this project is to find the optimal routing for delivering goods across a road network while minimizing travel times.

    "\n",
    "In the context of the problem you're tackling (which likely involves multiple delivery points, vehicles, and capacity constraints), we use Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) instead of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) because VRP generalizes TSP. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple Vehicles: In VRP, multiple vehicles are used to service several locations, which is more realistic for logistics, delivery, and transportation problems. TSP only considers a single vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Capacity Constraints: VRP includes the concept of vehicle capacity. Vehicles have a limit on how much they can carry, which needs to be considered during route planning. TSP does not account for any such limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Different Routes: In VRP, each vehicle has its own route to minimize costs (e.g., distance, time) while covering all locations. In TSP, there is only one route (cycle) for a single vehicle."
