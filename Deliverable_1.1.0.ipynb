    "CesiCDP has been tasked with creating an innovative solution in response to ADEME's call for promoting new mobility solutions. This project aims to optimize delivery routes across road networks, minimizing travel times while addressing real-world challenges such as varying traffic conditions and fluctuating delivery demands. The problem is formulated as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a key challenge in logistics and transportation optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VRP can be viewed as an extension of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), both of which are NP-complete. In this document, we will demonstrate that the VRP is NP-hard, reinforcing its computational complexity. By formally modeling the problem, analyzing its complexity, and exploring its relationship with the TSP, we aim to lay a solid theoretical foundation. This groundwork will support the development of efficient algorithmic solutions for determining optimal delivery routes, factoring in real-world constraints like traffic variations and demand fluctuations at delivery points."

    "### Problem to be solved\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to optimize the routing of goods across a road network to minimize travel time. This optimization problem is formulated as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), incorporating additional constraints to reflect real-world challenges such as varying traffic conditions and delivery point demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Why Use VRP Instead of TSP? </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a related optimization problem, the VRP is a more suitable framework for this project due to its ability to handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple Vehicles: VRP allows for the assignment of multiple vehicles to service different delivery points, reflecting the logistical realities of many transportation scenarios.\n",
    "- Capacity Constraints: VRP can incorporate constraints on vehicle capacities, ensuring that routes are planned to accommodate the volume of goods being transported.\n",
    "- Individual Vehicle Routes: VRP enables the optimization of routes for each vehicle, potentially resulting in more efficient and cost-effective transportation plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Computational Complexity:</u>\n",
    "The VRP is classified as an NP-hard problem, meaning that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm capable of finding optimal solutions for all instances. This computational complexity arises from the combinatorial nature of the problem, as the number of possible routes grows exponentially with the number of delivery points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Relationship to TSP:</u>\n",
    "While certain simplified instances of the VRP can be reduced to the TSP (e.g., when there is only one vehicle or when constraints are relaxed), the general VRP problem is more complex due to its additional features. Therefore, direct reduction to TSP is not generally feasible."
